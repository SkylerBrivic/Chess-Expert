		<p class = "indentation">We've all been there: you had a big lead and then blundered away your queen.
		You were up by 10 points, but then got back-rank checkmated. We all have those days 
		every now and then. However, when they start to happen too often, and when wins become
		a rare commodity, it can feel like you'll never improve at the game...</p>	
		
		<p class = "indentation">I know this feeling all too well. Believe me, by now I've lost 100 times more games than the
		number of games you've played in your life. But every loss was not a defeat. Rather, it was
		an opportunity to learn how to improve at the game. When I was checkmated by my opponent in	
		a way I'd never seen before, I would be glad that they had done that, because now I would have
		a new strategy to try during my next chess game. </p>
		
		
		<p class = "indentation">The years and years of agonizing losses would soon bear fruits, as my FIDE rating reached
		heights I could only have dreamed would be possible. This all culminated in the now iconic game Vygovsky
		vs. Kasparov, in which I checkmated the then world champion Garry Kasparov in just 20 moves 
		to become the undisputed world champion of chess!</p>
		
		<p class = "indentation">At this point you may be thinking, "it would take me decades to get good enough at chess
		to become a chess master." But fear not! ChessExpert.com is here to help you reach your peak 
		chess potential in the quickest timespan possible! From information on endgames to examples 
		of games from grandmasters, we have all the information you need to go from chess dud to chess
		stud! Don't believe us? Then start exploring our site and let us prove you wrong!</p>
