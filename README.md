# Chess-Expert

## Summary

This project is a website I made for a web programming class at Westchester Community College in 2018. The assignment was to design an informative website on a topic of our choosing. In my case, I chose to create a website about chess, since I like to play chess. The site is written from the perspective of a fictional chess grandmaster named "Borris Vygovsky," who gives advice to aspiring chess students on his website "www.ChessExpert.com" (this domain isn't actually registered to anyone right now). The website contains descriptions of tactics, strategies for chess endgames, and examples of famous chess games.

## Project Structure

The folder CSS_Style_Sheet contains the CSS file named StyleSheet.css, which contains the majority of the CSS code for the website.

The folder images contains all of the images that are displayed on the website.

The folder HTML_Files contains 5 HTML files, which correspond to the 5 webpages of the site. One of these pages is the site home page (which includes a survey on it), one is a page describing tactics, one is a page describing chess endgames, one is a page describing famous chess games, and one is a thank you page that a user is sent to when they fill out the survey on the site home page.

The folder screenshots contains a screenshot of each of the 5 webpages.
